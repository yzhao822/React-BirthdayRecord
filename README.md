The component has the following functionalities:
- The application's initial state displays a table where the unsorted list of people records must be rendered.
- The radio buttons to sort by 'Name' or 'Age' are toggled when clicked, so that only one is selected at a time.
- Clicking the radio button to sort by 'Name' must sort the list by ascending name.
- Clicking the radio button to sort by 'Age' must sort the list by descending age (i.e., ascending date).


The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

- The radio button to sort by 'Name' should have the data-testid attribute 'name'.
- The radio button to sort by 'Age' should have the data-testid attribute 'age'.
- The table displaying the names and dates should have the data-testid attribute 'table'.


Please note that component has the above data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
